    <p>
      This headwear is based on <i>dark aesthetics</i>.
      The main element I want to show is the creepy, frightening style.
      The key notions of the project are â€”the fantastic, the Gothic, the grotesque, the uncanny.it's a fascination with the evil passions of man, an emphasis on the ugly and the monstrous, an obsession with morbidity and death, a blurring of the boundaries between reality and imagination.
    <b>I want to create a feeling of fantasy and fairytale.</b>
